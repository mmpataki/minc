To make this project successful please train yourself to be compatible with
these coding-styles. This may not be so important but after a time you will not
start to hate your own code.


*	Use lower-case for the non-terminals, this makes them to be identified
	by the programmer easily.

*	Use upper-case for the terminals, this makes them distinct from the
	other symbols.

*	Don't use the string literals, operators, special characters,
	delimiters in string form in the grammar specification(YACC) this makes
	the rules to look crappy.

*	Last but not the least, don't use shorthands.

*	Spaces are not a replacement for tabs. Don't be so MicroSoftic to use
	spaces instead for tabs

*	Don't use the textwrapping property of your editor. Always keep your
	line of code's length <= 80 chars this helps people using different
	terminals to see wholle line at once.

*
